# Analysis Documentation

## Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analysis is implemented in the application to help users understand their financial situation by visualizing their data. The following key visualizations are used:

1. Expense Distribution (Pie Chart): This chart visualizes the proportion of different expense categories (e.g., rent, groceries, transportation) to help users see where most of their money is spent.

2. Monthly Spending Trends (Bar Chart): This bar chart shows how spending in various categories changes month over month, providing insights into seasonal spending patterns or fluctuations.

3. Transaction History (Line Chart): The line chart tracks a user's spending or savings over time, helping them visualize trends and detect anomalies or irregularities in their financial behavior.

These visualizations provide users with easy-to-understand insights into their financial data, allowing them to identify areas for improvement or opportunities for cost savings.

## Predictive Analysis
Machine learning model implementation:
```python
def train_prediction_model(data):
    X = prepare_features(data)
    y = data['savings_ratio']
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    return model, accuracy

def generate_recommendations(data):
    # Rule-based analysis
    recommendations = []
    if data['savings_ratio'] < 20:
        recommendations.append("Consider increasing savings")
    
    # Category-specific analysis
    for category, amount in data['expenses'].items():
        if amount > (data['income'] * 0.3):
            recommendations.append(f"High spending in {category}")
    
    return recommendations
```

## Key Components of the Predictive Model:
- Features: The model uses user data, including income, expenses, and spending patterns, to predict the savings ratio.

- Model: The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the dataset and evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting the savings ratio.

- Evaluation: The model’s performance is measured using the accuracy score, which indicates how well it predicts the savings ratio on unseen data.

## Prescriptive Analysis
Prescriptive analysis involves generating personalized recommendations based on predictive models and user data. The application uses the following criteria for generating recommendations:

1. Current savings ratio: Based on the user's savings ratio, the application suggests strategies for improving their savings (e.g., "Increase savings to reach 25% of income").

2. Spending patterns: The system analyzes the user's spending habits and highlights areas where they may be overspending (e.g., "Consider cutting down on dining out").

3. Category thresholds: The application flags categories where spending exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., "High spending in entertainment" if the user spends more than 30% of their income on entertainment).

4. Historical trends: By analyzing past spending behavior, the application can provide insights into areas where users may need to adjust their habits (e.g., "Your spending on healthcare has been consistently high—consider budgeting more for it").

These recommendations are tailored to help users make informed decisions and take proactive steps to improve their financial health.
