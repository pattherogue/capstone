# Hypothesis Assessment

## Initial Hypotheses
The following hypotheses were proposed to guide the development and testing of the Personal Finance Management Web Application:

1. Users can improve savings through expense tracking: Users who track their income and expenses can better manage their finances and save more effectively.

2. Machine Learning can provide meaningful financial insights: Using machine learning, the application can generate actionable insights based on user data, helping users optimize their spending and savings.

3. Visual analytics improve financial understanding: Users will gain a better understanding of their financial situation through interactive visualizations and graphs.

4. Personalized recommendations lead to better decisions: By providing tailored suggestions, users will make smarter financial decisions, improving their overall financial health.

## Testing Results
The hypotheses were tested through various methods, and the results are as follows:

1. Savings Improvement

- Accepted: The hypothesis that users can improve their savings through expense tracking was supported.

- Evidence: Analysis of users' transaction history showed an increase in savings rates over time after the implementation of expense tracking. Users were able to identify areas of overspending and adjust accordingly.

2. Machine Learning Insights

- Accepted: The hypothesis that machine learning can provide meaningful financial insights was supported.

- Evidence: The machine learning model predicting savings ratios achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. This demonstrates the model's ability to generate useful insights for users, such as predicting potential savings outcomes based on their spending patterns.

3. Visual Analytics

- Accepted: The hypothesis that visual analytics improve financial understanding was supported.

- Evidence: UI interaction metrics showed that users engaged more with the visualizations (such as pie charts, bar charts, and line charts) compared to other features in the application. This indicates that the visual representation of data effectively enhances users' comprehension of their financial situation.

4. Recommendation Effectiveness

- Accepted: The hypothesis that personalized recommendations lead to better decisions was supported.

- Evidence: Behavioral analysis of users showed a positive change after receiving tailored recommendations. For example, users who received suggestions to reduce spending in certain categories (e.g., dining out, entertainment) followed those recommendations, leading to improved savings.
